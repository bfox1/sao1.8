FAQ
---

* I get merge errors when I try to pull `master` to this branch! Help!

Uh... Why are you pulling from `master`, anyway? This branch is supposed to *overwrite* `master` on each good build.

* I get merge errors when I try to push this branch to `master`! Help!

That's normal. Try pushing again with the `-f` option (for a total of `git push -f origin master`)
